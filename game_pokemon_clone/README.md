Trying Pokemon game using Flutter (Android game dev) 

Followed youtube tutorial of MITCH KOKO - however, he conveniently left out the fun parts of coding like pokebattle & UI.

Things to add:
1. Add a message box when you try to walk past prof oak
 -  Add a condition in moveup function to change state of oakDirection(changes the oak image to turn right) and chatStarted ()
 - Create a class for Dialogue box. give it bgcolor, padding & some text
 - Hit the 'a' button to exit the dialoguebox by setting chatStarted to false
 - The game should pause when the dialogue is running.
 - The dialogue box should be of a fixed width and height always. figure out how to make the text left-aligned with proper padding.(maybe use widgets like column, expanded, stack to accomplish the dialogue box goals)

2. Start a poke battle
