Trying Pokemon game using Flutter (Android game dev) 

Followed youtube tutorial of MITCH KOKO - however, he conveniently left out the fun parts of coding like pokebattle & UI.

Things to add:
- Add a message box when the prof oak turns to you (maybe add a UI folder to lib folder and then display it on the stack widget after the map & boy & oak widget)
- Start a poke battle
